  <p>Here is an improved cosmetic case designed by Xiaotian.Gu. We found out the problem that it is inconvenient for cosmeticians to carry too much cosmetics with them when they need to go on a business trip or go out for exterior footage. To achieve improvements, we added a telescopic handle which transforms it from hand-held style to pull-out style like a travel luggage, and a detachable tripod was used to assemble with the case body and the whole structure can be upright. Moreover, the interior design was rearranged to be more rational. This new design solved several problems that cosmeticians complain in their daily life, and have got good reputation.</P>

<p>According to the requirements management approach of the client, it's difficult for pet doctors to do some simple actions such as taking dog's temperature, cutting a bandage and recording the weight of the animal wearing protective gloves. Otherwise, they have to take off them but it's easy to get hurt. Combining all the information we collected and discussed, finally we decide to design a pair of gloves whose finger part can be taken off easily, thus ensuring them work safely and conveniently.</p>
