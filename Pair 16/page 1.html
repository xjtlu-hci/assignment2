        Dyxion is a small design studio with two members, which focus on product design. <br>
        The name "dyxion" comes from the names of two members: Duanyang Geng and <br>Yuxuan Lou.<br><br>

        Yuxuan Lou will become one of the greatest designers in this universe. He still<br>
        keeps his great ideas in his mind for now but he will change the world one day. <br>
        While Duanyang Geng is just a little bit better than him.<br><br>

        In addition, Yuxuan Lou is good at imitate others' voice, especially Wing's. Therefore,<br> the
        introduction videos to our products sound like from Wing, but actually the truth <br>is that
        these are from Yuxuan.<br><br>

        So, basically, +1s...<br>
